This workflow also works for **solo developers** (self-approval).

2. Go to your repository and click **Compare & pull request** (if GitHub shows a banner)  
   _OR_ click **Pull Requests** ‚Üí **New pull request**.
3. Choose:
   - **base:** `main`
   - **compare:** your feature branch
4. Add a title and description ‚Üí click the green **Create pull request** button.

### üîÑ Resetting if Something Goes Wrong
If you get stuck:
1. Delete your local branch and re-pull `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git branch -D <your-feature-branch>
